	  - Pretty-printing of userdata honours the __tostring
	    metamethod.

	* Released version 0.3 with the following changes:
	  - Changed pretty-printing to always honour __tostring
	    metamethods.

	    completion only if nothing else matches.

	* Released version 0.3.1 with the following changes:
	  - Fixed numerous memory leaks as well as a minor off-by-one
	    bug in the file name completion generator.  Sources now
	    hold up to scrutiny by Valgrind.
	  - Removed the use of wordexp() to expand the path to the
	    history file.  Its use probably caused more problems than
	    it solved due to its unavailability on some platforms.

	* Released version 0.4 with the following improvements:

	  - The auto-completer now adds certain useful suffixes to
	    completed symbol names depending on their type.  An opening
	    parenthesis is added to function values and either a dot
	    or an opening bracket is added to table values.

	  - Symbol names can be excluded from consideration during
	    completion if they start with a configurable prefix.  This
	    allows, for example, variables starting with an underscore
	    to be treated as "hidden".

	  - Multi-line statement handling has been improved by treating
	    the whole statement as a single line, when browsing through
	    the	command history.

	* Released version 0.5 with the following improvements:

	  - The auto-completer now completes module names based on
	    package.preload, pacakge.path and package.cpath.  Module
	    names are either completed within strings for use with
	    require or as a global variable, as if the module was
	    already loaded.  In the latter case the tab completer also
	    loads the module once it's fully completed and exports it
	    as a global variable so that further completions apply to
	    the module's table.

	  - Completion can be disabled individually for certain kinds
	    of symbols via compile-time switches.

	* Released version 0.6 with the following improvements:

	- Switched to LuaRocks-based building/distribution.
	- Converted luaprompt to a proper Lua module.
	- Added saving of results into a table.
	- Added support for completion based on __index being a table.
	- Fixed filename completions to allow continuing completion into
	  subdirectories.
	- Various bugfixes.

2015-11-19  Dimitris Papavasileiou  <dpapavas@gmail.com>

	* Released version 0.7 with the following improvements:

	- Luap now sets rl_readline_name, to allow luaprompt-specific
	  readline configuration.
	- Added globalization of already loaded modules, which are not in
	the globals table.
	- Added a Makefile to allow building and installing without
	Luarocks.
	- Added a manpage (not installable via LuaRocks).
	- Various bugfixes.

2023-07-25  Dimitris Papavasileiou  <dpapavas@protonmail.ch>

	* Released version 0.8 with the following improvements:

	- Luap now loads and executes a file at startup, allowing custom
	  configuration and startup actions.
	- Added support for dynamic prompts.
