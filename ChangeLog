	* Released version 0.3.1 with the following changes:
	  - Fixed numerous memory leaks as well as a minor off-by-one
	    bug in the file name completion generator.  Sources now
	    hold up to scrutiny by Valgrind.
	  - Removed the use of wordexp() to expand the path to the
	    history file.  Its use probably caused more problems than
	    it solved due to its unavailability on some platforms.

	* Released version 0.4 with the following improvements:

	  - The auto-completer now adds certain useful suffixes to
	    completed symbol names depending on their type.  An opening
	    parenthesis is added to function values and either a dot
	    or an opening bracket is added to table values.

	  - Symbol names can be excluded from consideration during
	    completion if they start with a configurable prefix.  This
	    allows, for example, variables starting with an underscore
	    to be treated as "hidden".

	  - Multi-line statement handling has been improved by treating
	    the whole statement as a single line, when browsing through
	    the	command history.
